# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit-plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Per `.specify/memory/constitution.md` v1.0.0, the following gates apply:

- **Gate 1 — Spec-First Conformance**: If this feature implements an external protocol (A2A, MCP, JSON-RPC, OpenAPI, MCP), link the canonical spec here and state the conformance scope. If not applicable, write `N/A — no external protocol`.
- **Gate 2 — Subagent Delegation**: Delegation table below (next section) maps every phase to an owner from `.specify/memory/agents.md`.
- **Gate 3 — Contract Tests Before Implementation**: For each protocol surface, contract test tasks must appear before their implementation tasks in `tasks.md`. State here which surfaces require contract tests, or `N/A`.
- **Gate 4 — Reversible Config Changes**: If this feature touches `global/`, document the rollback path here. Otherwise `N/A`.
- **Gate 5 — Minimal Skill & Agent Surface**: If this feature adds a new skill or agent, justify why an existing one cannot be extended. Otherwise `N/A`.

Any violation must be either resolved or recorded in the Complexity Tracking table with explicit justification.

## Subagent Delegation

*GATE: Must reference `.specify/memory/agents.md` before generating tasks.*

This project has named subagents (`@dotnet-architect`, `@python-architect`, `@frontend-architect`, `@react-architect`, `@frontend-css`, `@unity-architect`, plus testers and orchestrators). Read `.specify/memory/agents.md` and produce a delegation table mapping each phase of work to its owner.

| Phase / concern | Owner | Why |
|---|---|---|
| [e.g., backend service layer] | [e.g., `@python-architect`] | [e.g., FastAPI structure decision] |
| [e.g., backend tests] | [e.g., `@python-tester`] | [e.g., pytest + real DB] |
| [e.g., UI components] | [e.g., `@react-architect` or `@frontend-architect`] | [e.g., matches/does-not-match 2025 stack] |
| [e.g., styling] | [e.g., `@frontend-css`] | [always — never let a framework agent do CSS] |
| [orchestration / cross-cutting] | `main` | [e.g., spans multiple domains] |

If no specialist matches a phase, explain why in the table and assign `main`. Do not invent agent names — use only those in `agents.md`.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
